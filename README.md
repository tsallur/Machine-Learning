# Machine-Learning_Project1

This is the first project I did for Machine Learning. This is a supervised learning linear regression algorithm that gets its data via filename from the command line.
These are the following data fields that I used to train my algoirthm:
Transaction date
House age (years)
Distance to the nearest MRT Rapid Transit subway station (meters)
The number of convenience stores nearby
The geographic coordinate, latitude (degrees)
The geographic coordinate, longitude (degrees)
It will ask for a training set and then a validation or test set. After those have been entered the program will give you the final weights and the adjusted r^2 value.
There will be 3 sets of these since the program uses the orginal weights, sqaured weights, and then original weights and squred weights as features.
